# Classification Project: Predicting Rain Tomorrow

## **Purpose**
This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The dataset, sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, covers observations from 2008 to 2017 and includes features such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and humidity. The goal is to build models that can assist in understanding and predicting weather patterns.

## **Methodology**
The project involves the following key steps:

**Data Acquisition:** The dataset was obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology and processed to include additional columns like 'RainToday' and 'RainTomorrow.'

**Data Preprocessing:** Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and values in the 'RainTomorrow' column were transformed into binary format. Unnecessary columns, such as 'Date,' were dropped, and the dataset was converted to a suitable format for model training.

**Model Selection:** Several classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. Each model was trained on a subset of the data and assessed using metrics like accuracy, Jaccard index, F1 score, and log loss.

**Evaluation:** The models were evaluated on their ability to predict rain tomorrow based on the chosen metrics. Results provide insights into the performance and strengths of each algorithm.

**Reporting:** A comprehensive report was generated, summarizing the methodology, key findings, and evaluation metrics for each model. The report facilitates a clear understanding of the project's objectives and outcomes.

## **Findings**
The project provides a comparative analysis of different machine learning algorithms in the context of weather prediction. The chosen metrics offer a holistic view of model performance, aiding in the selection of the most suitable algorithm for this specific prediction task.

## **Conclusion**
By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project contributes to the understanding of weather patterns and the development of predictive models for rain forecasting. The findings can be valuable for various applications, including agriculture, infrastructure planning, and emergency preparedness.
